            <p class="p-3 fs-5"><b>Learn more about me!</b></p>
            <p>Hello! My name is Skylar Shapiro-Frost (She/Her), computer programmer, LCC graduate, and lover of cats. In my free time I enjoy archery, video games , and spending time with my family. My interest in computer science comes from my desire to build new things and solve problems. Ever since I learned how to make my first website with just basic HTML, I have been passionate about learning as much as I can. Anything UI/UX design to backend and database management has been interesting to me.</p>
            <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have cultivated many skills that have been very helpful in my career. I have learned how to trouble-shoot issues during my time as a tech support agent and the hours spent debugging my code. I have developed my eye for detail while working on building applications. I have had to learn to work on my own, but also have learned how to adapt to working with a team on bigger and more complex projects. 
            </p>
            <p>As a programmer, my goal is to learn everything I can. I have no issue learning new technologies and stepping outside of my comfort zone. It's not enough for me to know something works, I feel the need to know how it works. I feel my desire to learn is a core part of who I am as a programmer and as a person.</p>
            <p>In the future, I would like to learn more about machine learning and electrical engineering. I would like to be able to develop the skills to create devices that can improve life for people, and make  the world a better place. I believe that it is necessary for me to take the skills I have learned and use them to help others in any way I can. </p>
